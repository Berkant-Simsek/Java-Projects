# Java-Projects

## Project 1
Nowadays, we encounter various problems in stores like it is hard to keep track of everything if you are a boss and it is hard to figure out which product is more suitable for you, especially when you don’t buy it very often like with electronic devices. We think that making one app that can help the boss the worker and the customer with their daily requirements would make life easier. Project aims to give variant information about an electronics store. What makes this project superior to other projects is that it serves more than one group of people, for instance, the head of the store can use it to learn more information about the store’s stock situation, the worker would use it to check payment information and costumer would use it to know more about any device in the store that he is curious about. We think that we can serve different people in different positions simultaneously with this project.
